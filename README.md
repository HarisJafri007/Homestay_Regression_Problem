A Regression Model applied to homestay data set.

Looking at different variables, we need to predict the homestay price.

First Data Set is uploaded in a Data Frame in housestay_prices.ipynb file, Data Frame is then cleaned and prepared to create 6 Data Frames and those 6 Data Frames are then saved as csv file.

Model is applied on one of the Data Frame where null values are replcaed with Mean and Outliers are not treated at all. Then we check the Accuracy and Mean Abs Error of the Model. All of this is done in df_mean.ipynb file.
